                        <p>I have had Randy maintaining my equipment for several years.  It seems like right after I call him, he is at my home resolving my problem. Randy found a crack in my furnace and when I called my home warranty company to come out to access the problem, I was told everything was fine.  It was Randy's honesty and  due diligence that enabled me to haggle with my warranty company.  Randy actually showed me the crack so I was armed with creditable knowledge.  Thanks for all your efforts. <span>-- Norma P.</span></p>

                        <p>We have called on Randy several times when we have had air conditioning and heater issues. On one occasion, we had another company come out first. After two unsuccessful attempts to fix the problem, we called Randy, who diagnosed and fixed the problem in just a few minutes! We know that we can always trust Randy to be fair and honest. <span>-- Linda S.</span></p>
